## Overview

This was the first Frontend Mentor challenge that I have completed that included not just HTML and CSS, but also Javascript. This was a fun and exciting challenge that really put my DOM manipulation skills to the test. This project has a lot of real world applications, so I feel like it is a perfect fit for my portfolio.

My time on this project was 3:42:11.

## My process

As with all my projects, I always start with HTML. The structure of your website is the most important aspect. Next I assign classes and ids for my elements and start work on the styling. I find it best to always get the easy parts out of the way, so I usually start off with fonts and colors. After that comes positioning, spacing, and active states.

I finished the project off by writing the scripts. Since this was my first challenge that included Javascript, I made sure to save it for last so I could spend the most time on it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

This challenge was a perfect test of my knowledge of manipulating the DOM. It was not too difficult at my current level of expertise, but still gave me a good challange and taught me quite a few new techniques. Here are some snippets from my js file that I am proud off:

```js
button1.style = null

ratingRequest.style.display = "none"
thankYouDisplay.style.display = "flex"
```

I also used a gradient color background for the first time during this challenge. I believe I applied this very well.

```css
.card {
  background-image: radial-gradient(circle at 32.5% 10%, hsl(213, 19%, 18%), hsl(216, 12%, 8%));
  background-size: 175%;
}
```

### Continued development

My knowledge of Javascript and DOM manipulation is still very limited, so I plan to study these topics more in the future. Javascript is a very vital part of frontend development and projects like this are the perfect way to practice.

I can't wait to start my next challenge!
